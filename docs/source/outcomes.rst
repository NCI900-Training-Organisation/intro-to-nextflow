.. note::
 1.  Learn how to use Nextflow

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Nextflow to build scalable and reproducible computational 
workflows. Nextflow is a powerful workflow orchestration tool designed for data-intensive 
applications, particularly in bioinformatics and scientific computing. We will cover the basics of 
writing Nextflow scripts, defining processes and workflows, handling input/output, and integrating 
with container technologies like Docker and Singularity. By the end, you'll understand how to create 
and execute Nextflow pipelines efficiently to automate complex data processing tasks.
